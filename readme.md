# Shopping Cart Functionality

This project implements a simple shopping cart system where users can **add** and **remove** items from the cart. It uses vanilla JavaScript to manage the item count, ensuring users can only add up to 9 items to the cart. The project also provides a simple UI with buttons to add or remove items from the cart.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to the cart with a maximum limit of 9 items.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove items from the cart, with a restriction that they cannot remove items if the cart is empty.
- **Counter Display**: The number of items in the cart is displayed dynamically on the page.
